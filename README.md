# Project Title: FALL DETECTION WITH DEEP NEURAL NETS

Develop a model to perform human activity recognition, specifically to detect falls. Falls are an important health problem worldwide 
and reliable automatic fall detection systems can play an important role to mitigate negative consequences of falls.
The automatic detection of falls has attracted considerable attention in the computer vision and pattern recognition communities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
